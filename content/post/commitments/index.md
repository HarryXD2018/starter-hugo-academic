As a research beginner in the field of computer vision, it is common to run into difficulties when trying to understand other people's work, i.e, terminology, code not available, or downloading the datasets. Hence, to convenient others, I make the following commitments:

1. All published papers will be open-sourced on GitHub and Gitee when they are ready. 
2. The datasets or trained models will be downloaded to OneDrive and AliDrive at the same time. 
3. I will offer a Chinese version of my publication on my website. (As much as I can)
