abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to automatic generation of
  adequate distractors for a given question answer pair (QAP) generated from a
  given article to form an adequate multiple-choice question (MCQ). Our method
  is a combination of part-of-speech tagging, named-entity tagging,
  semantic-role labeling, regular expressions, domain knowledge bases, word
  embeddings, word edit distance, WordNet, and other algorithms. We use the US
  SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) practice reading tests as a dataset to
  produce QAPs and generate three distractors for each QAP to form an MCQ. We
  show that, via experiments and evaluations by human judges, each MCQ has at
  least one adequate distractor and 84% of MCQs have three adequate distractors.
